However, the guide spoke only in Spanish and the group was composed mainly by local families with kids and elders, which made everything very slow. We arrived at the Piedra de Peñol at the peak hour and we shared the view and photos with flocks of other people. The boat trip and lunch were very average. We ended up visiting Guatapé in only half an hour and for us this was supposed to be the highlight of the day trip. Indeed, the small town seemed very nice but we didn't have enough time to enjoy it.","author":"5bfcc63a5513e72bb32052ce","landscape":"5bfd6b6c456466042906819f","createdAt":"2018-11-27T17:27:50.576Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-27T17:27:50.576Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5bfd7efc45646604290681e5","rating":5,"text":"You must know that the Chicamocha cañon is one the most beautiful and impressive place in Colombia, and it's really worth to go.","author":"5bfcc63a5513e72bb32052ce","landscape":"5bfd6cbc45646604290681a2","createdAt":"2018-11-27T17:29:32.081Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-27T17:29:32.081Z","__v":0},{"_id":"5bfd7f4a45646604290681ec","rating":3,"text":"Tourist trap.","author":"5bfcca8f9e6b162bfd81d7ff","landscape":"5bfd6cbc45646604290681a2","createdAt":"2018-11-27T17:30:50.435Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-27T17:30:50.435Z","__v":0}]
