## Getting Started

> This app contains API secrets and passwords that have been hidden deliberately, so the app cannot be run with its features on your local machine.

## Download and install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 8 landscapes, 3 users, 20 comments, 16 reviews and 24 notifications. The logins for the authors are as follows:
